# FIXME when installing Tower standalone with the embedded database (i.e. without adding a host to the [database] group) and configuring AH to use the same DB, it fails because the firewall isn't opened for PostgreSQL by the installation playbooks. Not sure yet if it's something we should fix in this role, like:
# - name: Enable Standalone Database firewall ports
#   firewalld:
#     port: '{{ tower_database_port }}/tcp'
#     permanent: true
#     state: enabled
#     immediate: yes
#     zone: "{{ tower_firewalld_zone }}"
#   when:
#   - not tower_database_node|bool
#   - tower_database_port == tower_ah_pg_port  # if the ports are different, something is at least fishy
#   - tower_ah_pg_node == ansible_host or tower_ah_pg_node == inventory_hostname
...
